## The permutation part
![Permutaion circuit](https://github.com/punyansh-v/8-bit-encryptor-decryptor/blob/main/circuit_images/Permutation.png)

This part performs the first part of the process, according to the mode selected (0 for encryption and 1 for decryption), the multiplexer gives the output for the further processing. In decryption, the left and right half of bits are swapped because it is required in the beginning of decryption process. The details of permutaion is in the [problem statement PDF](https://github.com/punyansh-v/8-bit-encryptor-decryptor/blob/main/Problem%20Statement.pdf).

## Main Circuit
![Main Circuit](https://github.com/punyansh-v/8-bit-encryptor-decryptor/blob/main/circuit_images/Main%20Circuit.png)

At the bottom of the design, there is a 2-bit counter, as there are 4 rounds of encryption. When the counter is 0, the input from permutator is fed into input register(**U23**) Of circuit named '**Round 1**' using the multiplexers(**U21,U22**) . Then at the next positive edge of clock signal, the input is latched in the register until further change.

Now when the counter is non-zero, i.e. 1,2,3 , the multiplexer feedbacks the last output from '**round 1**' circuit to the input register (**U23**).
Synchronously, Round Keys are generated by '**RK_GEN**' circuit.
When the counter is 3, i.e. last round of encryption, on next count, i.e. 0, the **U26** register feeds the output for further processing.

## Round 1

This is heart of the design. this performs the main encryption process. The details of the process is in the [pdf](https://github.com/punyansh-v/8-bit-encryptor-decryptor/blob/main/Problem%20Statement.pdf). By solving the expressions obtained, the above circuit is designed.

## Round key generation
![Round key Generator](https://github.com/punyansh-v/8-bit-encryptor-decryptor/blob/main/circuit_images/RK_gen.png)

This is the Round key generator circuit. It converts Key of 8-bit to 6-bit round key of each round. Round key for each round is passed to the register, which is calculated using the mux and using the counter bots as selection modes. The round keys are fed to register which is a positive edge register, so, it is synchronous with the input register. The algorithm is detailed in PDF.

## Inverse Permutation

This circuit performs the final operation, it inverts the permutaion process, which was done in the first part of the circuit, and then is connected to the Output ports of the circuit.
