# 8-bit Enxryptor Decryptor
## Digital electronics design project
### Introduction
My name is Punyansh . I'm an electronics engineering student at IIT BHU Varanasi .

This is a project I made for the event "Digisim" (Digital design event) held under "Udyam" , the technical fest of Deptt. of ECE, IIT(BHU). 

It consists of a Encyptor device of 8-bit which uses a simplified version of DES algortihm, which uses 4 rounds of encryption. The device operates in two modes, Encryption and decryption.
The design of the circuit is elegant, so the rounds of encryption can be increased with slight modification. Details of algrotihm are in the Problem Statement PDF.

### Expanation of Circuit :
For explanation, please refer to Explanation.md
The design circuit is in the file named 'Proteus File'.
